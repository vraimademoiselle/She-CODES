API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.
In other words, an API is the messenger that delivers your request to the provider that you're requesting it from and then delivers the response back to you.
